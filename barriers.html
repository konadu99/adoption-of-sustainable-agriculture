      <h2>Barriers to Adoption</h2>
      <p>
        Despite its benefits, sustainable agriculture faces several challenges
        in Kentucky and beyond. These include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>High initial investment:</strong> Transitioning to new
          technologies, such as no-till planters or drip systems, requires
          upfront capital.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited knowledge and technical capacity:</strong> Some
          farmers lack access to extension training or demonstration plots
          (Reimer & Prokopy, 2019).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Short-term uncertainty:</strong> The benefits of sustainable
          practices often accumulate over several years, discouraging short-term
          adoption.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policy and incentive limitations:</strong> Current
          conservation programs may not adequately support smaller farms
          transitioning to sustainable systems.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Extension services, demonstration farms, and peer learning are essential
        to overcome these barriers. Collaborative programs between universities,
        agencies, and farmers are gradually improving the adoption rate across
        Kentucky (UK Extension, 2024).
