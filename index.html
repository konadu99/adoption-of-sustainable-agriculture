      <h2>Introduction: A Changing Landscape in Kentucky Agriculture</h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture has always been at the core of Kentucky's economy and
        cultural identity. From the rolling pastures of the Bluegrass to the
        corn and soybean fields of Western Kentucky, farming provides food,
        livelihoods, and heritage. Yet, Kentucky's agriculture now faces new
        challenges: unpredictable weather, declining soil fertility, increasing
        input costs, and market pressures. These challenges demand innovative
        and sustainable approaches to maintain productivity while protecting
        natural resources (FAO, 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sustainable agriculture offers a practical solution. It integrates
        ecological, economic, and social principles to ensure that food
        production supports current needs without compromising future
        generations (Altieri & Nicholls, 2017). Across Kentucky, more farmers
        are beginning to adopt sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) such as
        cover cropping, rotational grazing, precision irrigation, and integrated
        pest management, supported by programs from the University of Kentucky
        Cooperative Extension and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation
        Service (USDA NRCS, 2023).
