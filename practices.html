      <h2>Key Sustainable Practices Gaining Ground in Kentucky</h2>

      <h3>1. Conservation Tillage and Cover Cropping</h3>
      <img

        style="
          max-width: 100%;
          height: auto;
          margin: 15px 0;
          border-radius: 8px;
        "
      />
      <p>
        Conservation tillage implies that the farmers cultivate less soil, which
        helps preserve it in good condition and retain natural matter within the
        soil. When the soil is not planted, farmers plant cover crops like
        winter rye, crimson clover, and hairy vetch on the soil to ensure that
        the soil remains safe. They prevent the washing of soil, aid the
        movement of nutrients among plants and soil and keep small life in the
        soil alive (CTIC, 2022). According to the Kentucky Soil Health Coalition
        (2023), the farms which cultivate cover crops and less often use tilling
        experience improved water absorption into the soil and the
        well-developed structure of the soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Bourbon and Fayette Counties, for example, many producers
        participating in the Kentucky Soil Health Partnership have transitioned
        to no-till systems and observed a 15-25% reduction in erosion losses.

      <h3>2. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>

        alt="Integrated Pest Management practices showing biological control and monitoring techniques"
        style="max-width: 40%; height: auto; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 8px"
      />
      <p>
        Traditional pest control often depends on frequent pesticide
        applications. IPM takes a knowledge-based approach, integrating multiple
        tactics such as biological control, cultural practices, and selective
        pesticide use to minimize pest damage while reducing chemical inputs
        (Ehler, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        The University of Kentucky's IPM Program provides farmers with scouting
        services, pheromone traps, and training in pest identification. This
        allows growers to make informed decisions about when and how to apply
        pesticides, often reducing application frequency by up to 40%. This
        approach not only protects beneficial insects like bees and lady beetles
        but also cuts input costs (UK Extension, 2024).
      </p>

      <h3>3. Efficient Water and Nutrient Management</h3>

        alt="Drip irrigation system and water management practices on a Kentucky farm"
        style="

          border-radius: 8px;
        "
      />
      <p>
        Kentucky's variable rainfall patterns alternating between heavy storms
        and dry spells make water management a pressing concern. Farmers are
        increasingly adopting drip irrigation systems, moisture sensors, and
        variable-rate technology to optimize irrigation and fertilizer use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The University of Kentucky's Water Quality Extension Initiative (2024)
        promotes soil testing and nutrient management plans to prevent nutrient
        leaching and runoff into rivers such as the Kentucky River, Licking
        River, and Green River basins. These programs help farmers apply only
        the nutrients that crops need, reducing costs and protecting water
        quality (USDA NRCS, 2023).

      <h3>4. Rotational Grazing and Livestock Integration</h3>

        alt="Rotational grazing system showing livestock movement between pastures"

          max-width: 100%;

          border-radius: 8px;
        "
      />
      <p>
        Livestock production is vital to Kentucky agriculture, and rotational
        grazing the strategic movement of livestock between pastures has become
        a cornerstone of sustainable livestock management. This system allows
        grasses to recover, improves forage quality, and reduces soil compaction
        (Tittonell, 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
        According to research from the Kentucky Beef Network (2023), producers
        using rotational grazing have seen up to 25% higher forage yields and
        lower veterinary costs. Integrating livestock with crop production also
        enhances nutrient cycling, as manure returns organic matter to the soil.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Diversified Farming and Agroforestry</h3>

      <img
        src="images/agroImg.png"
        alt="Agroforestry system combining trees with crops and livestock on a Kentucky farm"
        style="
          max-width: 100%;
          height: auto;
          margin: 15px 0;
          border-radius: 8px;
        "
      />
      <p>
        Diversification reduces risk and strengthens ecological balance.
        Kentucky farmers are incorporating agroforestry (combining trees with
        crops or livestock), pollinator strips, and mixed cropping systems.
        These measures support biodiversity, provide habitat for beneficial
        organisms, and generate additional income streams through timber, honey,
        or specialty products (Gomiero, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
        Programs like the NRCS Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) offer
        financial incentives for farmers implementing these practices,
        encouraging more widespread adoption (USDA NRCS, 2023).
